Collected data science projects that aren't big enough to get their own
repository.

## Digit Recognizer

Various classifiers built around the MNIST labeled digits dataset. Initially
started as an entry to [this Kaggle
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

## Wine Analysis

A brief analysis of wine quality I built with Ray Weng and Ben Stewart.
Demonstrates a number of different classifier models and their performance on
the dataset.

## Breakfast Cereals

cereal nutritional information.
